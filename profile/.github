# Respiratory Bioinformatics and Molecular Biology (RBMB) group
This is the GitHub page of the RBMB research group at the University of Technology in Sydney (UTS). The RBMB group is being led by Alen Faiz, PhD, molecular biologist and geneticist. The primary interest of the RBMB group is to understand the biology of respiratory systems at the genetic and epigenetic levels, including under conditions of exposure to cigarette smoke and current medications (i.e. corticosteroids), pathogenesis of COPD, and recently COVID infections. The official website of the RBMB is located at [uts-bioinformatics.github.io](https://uts-bioinformatics.github.io).

## These repositories
Here you can find our bioinformatical pipelines, some default scripts, descriptions of datasets and presentations. On top of that, there are some template repositories for projects.
